```

```{r}
#two data.frame here: reviews and solutions
mergedData <- merge(reviews, solutions, by.x = "solution_id", by.y = "id", all = TRUE) #all = TRUE means if there is unmatched value, rows from both data.frame are kept, but one with a NA;

#Default - merge all common column names
intersect(names(solutions), names(reviews)) #find common column names
mergedData2 <- merge(reviews, solutions, all = TRUE) #generate a new dataframe with rows from both datasets, organized one by one

#Using join in the plyr package
df1 <- data.frame(id = sample(1:10), x = rnorm(10))
df2 <- data.frame(id = sample(1:10), y = rnorm(10))
arrange(join(df1, df2), id)
